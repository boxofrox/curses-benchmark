This program writes random characters to fill the terminal screen, and
reports on the resulting "frame rate". This is essentially a benchmark
for a text terminal using ncurses, but mostly serves as a quick
introduction to ncurses programming.

Usage: curses-benchmark [options]
Options:
-c   use color
